        If I leave here tomorrow
        Would you still remember me?
        For I must be traveling on, now
        'Cause there's too many places I've got to see
        
        But if I stay here with you, girl
        Things just couldn't be the same
        'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
        And this bird you cannot change

        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

        And the bird you cannot change
        And this bird you cannot change
        Lord knows I can't change
        Bye-bye, baby, it's been a sweet love, yeah-yeah
        Though this feeling I can't change
        
        But, please, don't take it so badly
        'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
        But, if I stay here with you, girl
        Things just couldn't be the same
        'Cause I'm as free as a bird now
        And this bird you cannot change

        Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

        And the bird you cannot change
        And this bird you cannot change
        
        Lord knows I can't change
        Lord, help me, I can't change
        Lord, I can't change
        Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah
