        <b>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
        And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
        When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
        With a word she can get what she came for
        Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven</b>

        <i>There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
        'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
        In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
        Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
        Ooh, it makes me wonder
        Ooh, makes me wonder</i>

        <u>There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
        And my spirit is crying for leaving
        In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
        And the voices of those who stand looking
        Ooh, it makes me wonder
        Ooh, really makes me wonder</u>

        <del>And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
        Then the piper will lead us to reason
        And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
        And the forests will echo with laughter
        Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa</del>
